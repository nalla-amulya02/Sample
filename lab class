for displaying multiple fields: cut -c 1 -14,69-75 first5.txt

apply the cut command:  wrt fields:   delimiter is':'
fields are separated by colons
file should be alligned -c

cut -d : -f 1,4 first5.txt | tee firstfourth.txt..........(display 1st and fourth column and take it into another file..it also takes the delimiter)
applications:

paste -d "|" firstfourth.txt second.txt ........mentioning the delimiter

-s opt: makes the content alligned 
paste -s data1...........combines every line into single line
paste -s -d ":::::\n" data1

sort command: sort the lines of the text files default  is 
sort data.txt.takes first col and sort it
-t -k number, -k num1,num2     -k num1.num2    -c -o filename
sorting based on fielsd
sort -t : -k 3 data.txt
sort -t : -r -k data.txt............sorted in reverse order
sort -t : -k 1,1 -k 3,3 data.txt

uniq firstfile.txt........removes the repetitions
used with sort command
output of sort command as the input of uniq command to remove the dedundant data
uniq file1 file2......inputs is file1 and gives the output to file 2

to select the nonrepeated line of the file, cut sort uniq

cut -d ":" -f 1 first5.txt | sort | uniq -u........shows the nonrepeated lines

we can count the freq of occurence 
cut -d ":" -f 1 first5.txt | sort | uniq -c



üòÅÔ∏ètr command: apply the filtering onto the etxt file.....all the individual char are translated or deleted
